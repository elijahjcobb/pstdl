			<p>Further data collection for NASAâ€™s RedWater project will utilize a Martian pressure rated vacuum chamber located in the Planetary Surface Technology Development Lab.</p>
			<p>This test setup specifically seeks to gather information about the energy required to melt through cryogenic ice within a lower pressure atmosphere. The MTVAC will likely also be used in preliminary testing and validation of vacuum and temperature rated hardware.</p>
			<h3>Specification</h3>
			<p>Our brand new 18 inch cube vacuum chamber (10-2 torr) with LN2 feedthrough for cooling of iceblocks and regolith/ice/volatile mixtures plus various other ports for thermocouples, etc. currently used for determining cryo-ice melting energies and probe designs. The LN2 feed and N2 exhaust will be tied into the same system as the large DTVAC.</p>
